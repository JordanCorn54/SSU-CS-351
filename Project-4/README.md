# CUDA
Question: Are the results what you expected? Speculate as to why it looks like CUDA isn’t a great solution for this problem.  
I I didn't expect iota.gpu to be so much slower than iota.cpu. Thinking about it after however, I suspect it has to do with the CUDA version's overhead, handling memory more.
